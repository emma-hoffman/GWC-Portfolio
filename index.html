    <h3>BEE EXTINCTION</h3>
    <p> Bee extinction is a large problem in the world today. In January of 2016, for the first time in history the honey bee was declared endangered in the United States. Can you imagine that? Something that we consider a nuissance because of its abundance is actually endangered. Bees although often times we are running away from them in fear are a significant part of our ecosystem. Not only do they help reduce global warming, but they pollinate plants that produce crops and flowers. THE BEE PROBLEM IS REAL AND WE NEED TO ACT NOW! Don't BEE a Hater, Save the Pollinators! </p>

    <center><i>Sponsor-A-Hive</i></center>
    <p> With the Conservancy's Sponsor-A-Hive program, you can donate money to the foundation in order to maintain the well being of a hive in the comfort of your own backyard. In this setting, you are being encouraged to embrace an individual passion for the cause. It's like owning your own pet which means there is a lengthy application process and a lot of responsibility. But think about the good you can do for our future!</p>

    <center><i>Adopt-A-Hive</i></center>
    <p> With the Castlemaine Bee Sanctuary, you can adopt a beehive without the responsibility of tending to the bees. This Sponsor-a-Hive program takes a small weekly fee from you and then takes care of the hives in their own sanctuaries with professional beekeepers. In return you are amounted a share of the honey made as a reward for your donation and aid to the cause.</p>
